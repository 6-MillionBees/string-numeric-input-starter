# string numeric input starter main


# Task 1
# Use the input( ) function to prompt the user to enter his/her first name and the name of the program they attend at Career Tech.
# Assign the user's responses to variables
# Use concatenation to build an output string that displays the user's answers
# Please use correct capitalization, spelling, and punctuation in your code




# Task 2
# prompt the user to enter their current age
# Assign their response to a variable age
# On the next line of code, use the int( ) function to convert the user's response to an integer (a number that doesn't have a decimal point)
# Display a sentence that contains the user's current age
# Challenge: Have Python add 10 years to the user's current age; then display a sentence that says what the user's age will be ten years from now




# Task 3
# Using the input( ) and int ( ) functions in a single line of code, prompt the user to enter the number of people in his/her family
# Use concatenation to display a sentence that says how many people are in the user's immediate family
# HINT: The Python str(  ) function might come in handy here!
# On the next line of code, use an f-string to display a sentence that says how many people are in the user's immediate family



# Task 4
# Using the input( ) and float ( ) functions in a single line of code, prompt the user to enter their height in inches (so 60 for 5'10" tall)
# Write a formula that tells Python how to do the math to convert inches into centimeters
# HINT: Define a constant called CONVERSION_FACTOR and assign it the value 2.54
# Use concatenation to display a sentence that says how tall the user is in inches AND in centimeters
# HINT: The Python str(  ) function might come in handy here!
# Also show you know how to use an f-string to display the user's height in both inches and centimeters
